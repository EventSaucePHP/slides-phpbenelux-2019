Hi everybody

Thank you for joining me here this morning. I hope you had a lot of fun at the conference yesterday, and I hope you had a little less fun last night, because today we're going to talk about EventSourcing. Which is a somewhat complex topic.


My mame is Frank. I'm a freelance developer based out of Amsterdam. I'm the maintainer of Flysytem. If you're a user of Flysystem and want a sticker, please come to me after the talk and I'll give one. Flysystem has was an unexpected huge success and allowed me to be involved with many other interesting projects as a freelance developer. And in one of those projects I had the pleasure to work with people that had extensive experience with eventsourcing.
